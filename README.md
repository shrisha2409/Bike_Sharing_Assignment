# Bike Sharing Assignment  
- A U.S. bike-sharing company, BoomBikes, has compiled a daily dataset on bike rentals influenced by various environmental and seasonal factors. The company aims to analyze this data to identify the key drivers of demand for shared bikes in the American market. With this understanding, BoomBikes intends to develop a strategic business plan to boost its revenue once the current lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic is lifted.

## General Information
-The project aims to help BoomBikes understand the demand dynamics for shared bikes in the post-COVID era. Its primary objective is to identify key variables influencing bike demand and to accurately predict future usage.
-This need stems from significant revenue declines due to reduced mobility during the pandemic. The project intends to facilitate strategic business planning to accelerate revenue growth once restrictions are lifted.
-The dataset consists of daily bike rental records, including variables such as weather conditions, seasonality, and user type (casual or registered), covering the years 2018 and 2019.

## Conclusions
- The linear regression model demonstrates a robust capacity to predict bike rental demand, achieving an R-squared score of approximately 0.826 on the test set. This indicates that the selected features are highly indicative of demand.
- Key factors such as seasonal trends and weather conditions, along with the rental year, significantly influence bike rental demand, underscoring the need for strategic planning around these variables.
-It is recommended to continuously monitor and update the model as more data becomes available, particularly in light of potential shifts in user behavior following the pandemic.
